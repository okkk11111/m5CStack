# m5CStack: An Integrated Framework for m5C Site Prediction Using Multi-Feature Stacking
RNA 5-methylcytosine (m5C) modification sites is essential for understanding the regulation of RNA functions in
various biological processes. However, the vast amount of sequence data generated by modern genomics poses significant
challenges for traditional identification methods, which often struggle to meet high-throughput demands. Consequently,
computational tools have become indispensable for predicting m5C sites. In this study, we present m5CStack, an advanced
ensemble learning framework designed to predict m5C modification sites with high accuracy. m5CStack integrates multiple
feature encoding techniques and machine learning models through a stacking architecture to enhance the robustness and
reliability of predictions. We evaluate the framework on RNA datasets derived from multiple species, including Homo
sapiens (human), Mus musculus (mouse), Drosophila melanogaster (drosophila), and Danio rerio (danio). Experimental
results demonstrate that m5CStack significantly outperforms previous prediction methods across a range of metrics,
including accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Furthermore, SHAP-based feature significance analysis reveals the key
contribution of specific features, further improving the interpretability of the model. Overall, this study highlights the
potential of m5CStack as a powerful tool for RNA modification profiling, offering new insights into the epigenetic regulation
of RNA across species.
